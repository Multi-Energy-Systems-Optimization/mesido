   * - ESDL attribute category
     - ESDL attribute
     - Definition

       (as interpreted by the simulator / optimizer)
     - Units
     - Required/Optional
     - Default value

       (in the front end)
     - Optimizer use
   * - Basic attributes
     - Name
     - Asset unique name
     - \-
     - Required
     - Generic unique name generated by the front end
     - \-
   * - Basic attributes
     - State
     - States if the asset is ENABLED or OPTIONAL
     - \-
     - Required
     - ENABLED
     - ENABLED:
       use the specific asset with all its specified attributes

       OPTIONAL:
       allows the optimizer to determine if the asset is required

       (if not then it will be removed from the network), else if

       the asset is required then it will be sized appropriately"

   * - Basic attributes
     - Technical Lifetime
     - Operational lifetime of the asset (min=1, max 50)
     - Years
     - Optional
     - \-
     - Once-off costs occur once per lifetime span
   * - Basic attributes
     - Power
     - Size of the heat pump in terms electical power input.

       Must be > 0.0
     - Watts
     - Required
     - 5000000
     - The electrical power capacity is used in conjuction with the COP

       to determine the heat produced on the heat pump secondary side

       If state=OPTIONAL: the Power is used as the upper limit for sizing the asset

   * - Basic attributes
     - COP
     - Coefficient of performance of the heat pump
     - \-
     - Required
     - 3.7
     - See heat pump Power attribute
   * - Ports
     - Inport and OutPort (2 of each)
     - Both the primary and secondary sides of heat pump have in-port

       and out-port.

       Required port naming convention is PrimIn, PrimOut, SecIn, SecOut.

       The primary and secondary side should be connected to hydraulically

       decoupled networks.

       Each port must have a carrier assigned to it.

       Required carrier temperatures are :math:`T_{PrimIn} > T_{PrimOut}`

       & :math:`T_{SecOut} > T_{SecIn}`
     - \-
     - Required
     - \-
     - Heat is transferred from the primary side to the secondary side

       (2 hydraulically decoupled networks).
