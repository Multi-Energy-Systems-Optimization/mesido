# [Unreleased] - 2024-10-07

## Added

- Limit the available pipe classes connetced to heat/gas demand/producers
- Add demands and sources to the topology object to have easy access to the connected pipes/cables later on
- Heating and cooling example case added (2 heating demands, 1 cold demand, hot and cold producer, WKO as seasonal storage)
- Gas physics documentation
- Gas & electricity 1st version of physics documentation
- Test case: Head loss validation with pandapipes.
- Example on ESDL file creation using pyESDL for the PoC Tutorial.
- Electrolyzer specific power curve valley location specified optionally specified in ESDL.
- Grow_workflow: Solver class created to allow the use of CPLEX as a solver for EndScenarioSizing classes.
- tests/test_runner.py: A custom test runner that collects range_data from from the scaling checks of tests models, as well as other detailed test run information.
- tests\utils_test_scaling.py: Include functions for scaling checks.

## Changed

- Cooling demand added to adapt_hourly_year_profile_to_day_averaged_with_hourly_peak_day (peak cooling day not used yet)
- Impact on the way EndScenarioSizing problems in MESIDO are run: The calling of the different optimization problem classes has been split from the solver classes. In EndScenarioSizing classes, the HIGHS solver is the default and the calling functions also cather for other solvers by adding the keyword "solver_class" with the respective solver class.
- Bugfix: No longer required to provide a power at the heating demands when a profile has been added.
- Bugfix: Scaling fix on ATES temperature variable when temperature modelling not used.
- Bugfix: Fix on nominals in electricity cables and gas pipes. Fix on nominals for nodes with logical links.
- Tests: Include scaling checks in multiple tests listed in tests\README.txt

## Fixed

- Bug fix: machine error/rounding with updating lower bound values in the grow_workflow after stage 1
- documentation: heat physics tank storage
- bug fix in grow_workflow (heat networks), changed minimum velocity from 0 to default value
- addition to tests checking the minimum velocity setting in a workflow


# [0.1.7] - 2024-08-23

## Added

- User feedback regarding demand type to be used in heat networks 
- Functionality to connect assets with logical links 

## Changed

- Increased time limit for stage 1, priority 1
- Replaced Retry loop to connect all assets and apply the correct modifiers of the linked assets

## Fixed

- Error exit when stage 1, priority 1 was not successful
